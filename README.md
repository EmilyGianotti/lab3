##Building and Invoking the Program##
To build the program, run "make clean" and then "make build". This will generate a bin directory with all the compiled Java classes corresponding to the source code.
To invoke the program, run "./schedule <flag> <filename>".

##Supported Command-line Options / Arguments##
-h -> produces a list of valid command-line arguments that includes a description of all command-line arguments required for Lab 3

<filename> -> produce, as output, an ILOC program that is equivalent to the input program, albeit reordered to improve (shortern) its execution time on the Lab 3 ILOC Simulator
